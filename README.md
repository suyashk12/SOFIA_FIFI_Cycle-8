These are analysis scripts written for analyzing IFU datacubes obtained through FIFI spectroscopy done by SOFIA, NASA's space telescope. The scripts perform the following functions -

1. Fluxmaps.ipynb - this creates a spectral density heatmap across the observed spaxels of the galaxy for all available wavelengths

2. Wavelength_Profile_Central.ipynb - this creates a spectral density plot against wavelength for a central n_x x n_y spaxel^2 window (user specified) of the galaxy

3. NGC_5253_[OIII]/[NIII].ipynb - this is an analysis pipeline that ultimately computes the flux values of the respective lines from the observed spectrum
